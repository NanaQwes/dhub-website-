        <h1>Welcome To University Of Cape Coast Design Thinking And Innovation Hub (D-HUB)</h1>
        <p>
            Unemployment is a global issue that affects both developed and underdeveloped countries. Data from the Institute of Statistics, Social and Economic Research (ISSER) of the University of Ghana, has revealed that only 10 per cent of graduates find jobs after their first year of completing school
        </p>
        <P>
            It is against this backdrop that the Design Thinking and Innovation Hub (D-Hub) was established under the Office of the former Vice Chancellor of the University of Cape Coast (UCC), Proffesor Johnson Nyarko Boampong.The D-Hub aims at creating a hub that gives faculty, staff and students opportunities to explore how design thinking might support teaching, scholarship and service. The hub also incubates innovative ideas of students, lecturers, and the community to grow them into viable businesses through entrepreneurship, innovation and continuous improvement.
